This is where all the components that will be used inside multiple pages should be generated

If one component will be used in multiple pages, it should be placed inside the global directory
If not, it should be placed inside the directory of the page it will be used in

TODO: Create Navbar, Footer, Hero, Mbutton, and the MLines (3 lines that are diagonal and that will be used inside every page)
If you see the need of generating other components that need to be used in multiple pages other than the ones mentioned,
feel free to generate them here
